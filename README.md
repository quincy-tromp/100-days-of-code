# 100 Days of Python üêç
My goal with this course is to practice my Python skill and take that next step towards mastery.
I was already familiar with Python from other courses/books, but still considered myself a beginner.
This course is project-based, so you get a lot of experience with programming.
I highly recommend this course on Udemy: 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.
