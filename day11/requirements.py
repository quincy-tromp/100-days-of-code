# The dealer deals a card to himself visible to everyone.

# Another card is dealt to the player facing upwards.

# The dealer deals a card for himself facing downwards.

# The player has to decide whether to stand with the current set of cards or 
# get another card.

# If the player decides to hit, another card is dealt to him.

# If the player decides to stand, then the dealer reveals his hidden card.

# The dealer does not have the option to decide whether to hit or stand. 
# The general rule is that the dealer needs to keep hitting more cards if the

# obliged to stand.

# The winner is decided according to the final sum of the cards.
