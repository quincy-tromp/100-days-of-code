#   Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen 
    for the "Up" keypress to move the turtle north. 

#   Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated 
    along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be
    generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen. 

#   Detect when the turtle player collides with a car and stop the game if this happens.

#   Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen. When this happens,
    return th turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars.

#   Create a scoreboard that keeps track of which level the user is on. Every time the 
    turtle player does a successful crossing, the level should increase. When the 
    turtle hits a car GAME OVER should be displayed in the center.
